\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
	Many decision-theoretic algorithms are used in general video game playing,
	because they are highly effective problem solvers.  ``Monte Carlo Tree
	Search'' (MCTS) is a popular decision-theoretic algorithm that has often
	been used for general video game playing.  The MCTS algorithm always plans
	over actions and does not incorporate any high level planning, as one would
	expect from a human player. Furthermore, although many games have similar
	game dynamics, often no prior knowledge is available to general video game
	playing algorithms.  In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm called
	``Option Monte Carlo Tree Search'' (O-MCTS). It offers general video game
	knowledge and high level planning in the form of options, which are action
	sequences aimed at achieving a specific subgoal. Additionally, we introduce
	``Option Learning MCTS'' (OL-MCTS), which applies a progressive widening
	technique to the expected returns of options in order to focus exploration
	on fruitful parts of the search tree. Our new algorithms are compared to
	MCTS on a diverse set of twenty-eight games from the general video game AI
	competition. Our results indicate that by using MCTS's efficient tree
	searching technique on options, O-MCTS outperforms MCTS on most of the
	games, especially those in which a certain subgoal has to be reached before
	the game can be won.  Lastly, we show that OL-MCTS improves its performance
	on specific games by learning expected values for options and moving a bias
	to higher valued options.
