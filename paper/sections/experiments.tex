This section shows how awesome the algorithm is

We constructed the following options. More options can be created, probably
improving the algorithm even more.
\begin{itemize}
	\item ActionOption executes a specific action once and then
		stops.
	\item AvoidNearestNpcOption makes the agent avoid the nearest NPC
	\item GoNearMovableOption makes the agent walk towards a
		movable game sprite and stops when it is within a certain range of the
		movable
	\item GoToMovableOption makes the agent walk towards a
		movable until its location is the same as that of the movable
	\item GoToNearestSpriteOfType makes the agent walk to the nearest sprite of
		a specific type
	\item GoToPositionOption makes the agent walk to a specific position
	\item WaitAndShootOption waits until an NPC is in a specific location and
		then uses its weapon.
\end{itemize}
