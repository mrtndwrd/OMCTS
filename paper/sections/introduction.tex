\todo{General introduction:}
Many AI solutions exist to solve specific tasks, but a generic algorithm
that can solve many tasks, regardless of their inner dynamics, can be viewed as
a good, multi-purpose algorithm. A set of challenging tasks is the set of Arcade
Games, which range from long term planning tasks like \emph{Boulder Dash}, a
puzzle game in which gems have to be collected in the right order, to quick
reaction tasks like \emph{Space Invaders}, a game in which aliens have to be
shot from the sky as quickly as possible, while evading their missiles. Several
real world problems can be modelled in a game form. Therefore, solving games can
be viewed as a stepping stone to solving more complex real world problems. 

\todo{Replace the above game examples with (different) examples in which the
algorithm works good}
