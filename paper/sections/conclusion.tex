Conclusion

In the future, in order to improve the learning algorithms, some improvement can
be investigated. Firstly, the option values are now saved using the mean of all
the games, without regarding how long ago this game was played. For doors that
unlock under specific conditions (for example when the key is picked up in
Zelda), one would probably want a discounted option value. More research should
then be done in using a discounted version of the variance for the crazy stone
algorithm.
