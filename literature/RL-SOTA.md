# CH5, Transfer in reinforcement learning
Options: Mostly mappings from states to actions
## 5.2: Three kinds of transfer
Instance transfer: Transfer samples for a model based approach. The most simple
version of instance transfer collects samples from a source task and reuses them
in learning the target task.
Representation transfer: Run an abstraction process on the model and transfer
that
Parameter transfer: Use the same initialization parameters on the new model as
the old.
