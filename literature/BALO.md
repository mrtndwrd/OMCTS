## Introduction
Active learning aims at accurately approximating a target concept with a limited
number of queries to an oracle.
AL = intractable, so there's BAndid-based Active Learner (BAAL). AL formulated
as single player game, using UCT-tree

## Background
$s_t = {(x_i, y_i), x_i \in X, y_i \in Y, i = 1 ... t}$ = training set of size t

## UCT with continuous domain and AL criteria
BAAL uses Progressive Widening, which I will probably also very much need!
